ASE
===

Developed at Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK Pretoria, 2012) for AfricanSchoolForExcellence.org, 
this repository contains the Python-based web server that runs in conjunction with the 
KhanAcademy.org server (which will run offline and locally hosted) to make the video and 
excercise material from Khan Academy available offline on low-cost Android tablets. 

It also contains scripts and documents on managing the Moodle instance that will be used in the 
ASE classroom.
