ASE Moodle:
===========

- Running Moodle 2.3.2+


Enrolment:
==========

- use the moodle_enrolment.csv file to set up users into a cohort, then upload
- create and try uploading some sample students with latest fields


Grading:
=======

- Can we grade per group? Ideally groups of 4, else individual
- Core/Expeditionary team math:
  - grade for accuracy 0 (unsatisfactory), 1 (needs work), 2 (good), 3 (exceptional)
  - grade for creativity
  - grade for persistence
- Core/Expeditionary instructional math: (teacher)
  - just a place for comments for each individual (if any)
- Core Independent math: (khan)
  - grading from KA (possibly automated)
- Expeditionary Independent math: (mental math and other, e.g. logic math)
  - done on pen & paper, marked by teacher, then capture pass/fail into Moodle
  - modules with pass or fail
  - ideally matrix of modules and students with ticks where students passed
  - students cannot move forward until all modules completed
- Independent Reading:
  - Ideally, for each reading story, completed or not
    - report of how many stories read, what level they are on, etc.
- Partner reading:
  - ? possibly grade or question-by-question
- Instructional reading:
  - place for comments


Setting up Khan Academy-style exercises:
========================================

- Create course (topic-based)
- Create Quiz activity
- Add "simple calculated" questions to question bank
  - e.g. {x} + {y}
  - set as "Immediate with retries"
  - set Hint 1 and Hint 2 for the retries
  - set success feedback and grade boundary feedback if necessary
  - generate a dataset for x and y
  - copy the question using the same generated data set as many times as needed
- Add the questions from the question bank into the quiz
- In Site administration > Advanced features, enable conditional access
  - now one activity can show based on passing the previous

Lesson plan:
============

- Add a "page" or "wiki" activity to the course and hide it
  - now only teachers can see and edit it

Grade a classroom of students:
==============================

- Open {course} > Grade administration > Grader report
- Turn editing on if needed
- To add feedback, click the edit icon next to grade
- Only editing teachers can do this
  - Allow "edit grades" permission to non-editing teachers
- Add manually graded items:
  - Select Categories and items
  - Add categories and items
  - Add scales to grade an outcome, e.g. poor, good, great
  - add outcomes to gradebook e.g comprehension, fluency, etc.

Enrol/unenrol cohorts in Course:
===============================
- 120 students, 6 classes of 20
  - TA only needs to grade 20 students
  - TA goes with 20 students through team math, individual math, etc.
  - Different TA's for different subjects

- First open {course} > Users > Enrolled users
  - add all cohorts using "Enrol cohort"
- Open {course} > Users > Enrolment methods (click on it, don't open it out)
  - /moodle/enrol/instances.php?id={courseid}
- hide/show cohorts as needed

Attendance record:
==================

- see http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Attendance_module
- Add attendance module to homoepage and set up sessions
  
Book library:
===============

Lesson evaluation:
==================


Teacher feedback of students:
=============================

- In grade report edit mode, add comments
- Add People block and use "participants" link to add/view notes on students

Teacher feedback of lesson:
===========================


Teacher as a student in a course:
=================================

TA feedback of Teacher:
=======================


Teacher feedback of TA:
=======================

Student feedback of teacher/TA:
===============================

Student feedback of lesson:
===========================

Sponsor view of student:
========================

- Add sponsor role and Mentees block as per http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Parent_role
- Add sponsor to student by editing student > Roles > assign roles relative to this user
- make sure Sponsor role has relevant moodle/user:* permissions
